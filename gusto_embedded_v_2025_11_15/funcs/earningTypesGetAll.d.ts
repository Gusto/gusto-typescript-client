 * A payroll item in Gusto is associated to an earning type to name the type of earning described by the payroll item.
 *
 * #### Default Earning Type
 * Certain earning types are special because they have tax considerations. Those earning types are mostly the same for every company depending on its legal structure (LLC, Corporation, etc.)
 *
 * #### Custom Earning Type
 * Custom earning types are all the other earning types added specifically for a company.
