     * If a company does not have any pay schedules, this endpoint creates a single pay schedule and assigns it to all employees (common during company onboarding).
     *
     * If a company already has an active pay schedule and wants multiple pay schedules, this endpoint creates a pay schedule that is not assigned to any employee.
     *
     * Be sure to [check state laws](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/state/payday) to know what schedule is right for your customers. If an onboarded company misses their first pay date, the pay schedule may be automatically adjusted.
