# Garnishment

Garnishments, or employee deductions, are fixed amounts or percentages deducted from an employeeâ€™s pay. They can be deducted a specific number of times or on a recurring basis. Garnishments can also have maximum deductions on a yearly or per-pay-period bases. Common uses for garnishments are court-ordered payments for child support or back taxes. Some companies provide loans to their employees that are repaid via garnishments.

import { Garnishment } from "@gusto/embedded-api/models/components/garnishment.js";

let value: Garnishment = {
  uuid: "35f43947-d369-48fa-9bf6-50232c8ad35b",
