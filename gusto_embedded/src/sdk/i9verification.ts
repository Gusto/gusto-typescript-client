   * If the version is supplied and the employee I-9 authorization exists, this endpoint acts as an update. Otherwise, it will create an employee I-9 authorization.
   *
   * Validations on this endpoint are conditional:
   *
   *   * `document_type` may be required, depending on `authorization_status`.
   *   * Valid formats for `document_number` vary, depending on `document_type`.
   *   * `country` is only allowed with `document_type: 'foreign_passport'`.
   *   * `expiration_date` is only allowed with `authorization_status: 'alien'`.
   *
   * > ℹ️ Unneeded information is automatically removed during updates.
   * >
   * > If an update causes some formerly-required fields to be unneeded, the now-unneeded data will be removed automatically.
   * >
   * > **Example:** Updating `authorization_status` from `alien` to `citizen` will cause any data in `document_type`, `document_number`, `country`, and `expiration_date` to be removed, since these fields are unused for `authorization_status:'citizen'`.
