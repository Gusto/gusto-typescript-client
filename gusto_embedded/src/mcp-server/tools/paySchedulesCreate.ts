  description: `Create a new pay schedule

If a company does not have any pay schedules, this endpoint will create a single pay schedule and assign it to all employees. This is a common use case during company onboarding.

If a company has an existing active pay schedule and want to support multiple pay schedules, this endpoint will create a pay schedule that is not assigned to any employee.

Be sure to **[check state laws](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/state/payday)** to know what schedule is right for your customers.
