Garnishments, or employee deductions, are fixed amounts or percentages deducted from an employeeâ€™s pay. They can be deducted a specific number of times or on a recurring basis. Garnishments can also have maximum deductions on a yearly or per-pay-period bases. Common uses for garnishments are court-ordered payments for child support or back taxes. Some companies provide loans to their employees that are repaid via garnishments.
