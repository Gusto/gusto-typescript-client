  description: `Finish company onboarding

Finalize a given company's onboarding process.

### Approve a company in demo
After a company is finished onboarding, Gusto requires an additional step to review and approve that company. The company onboarding status is \`"onboarding_completed": false\`, until the API call is made to finish company onboarding.
In production environments, this step is required for risk-analysis purposes.

We provide the endpoint \`PUT '/v1/companies/{company_uuid}/approve'\` to facilitate company approvals in the demo environment.

\`\`\`shell
PUT '/v1/companies/89771af8-b964-472e-8064-554dfbcb56d9/approve'

# Response: Company object, with company_status: 'Approved'
