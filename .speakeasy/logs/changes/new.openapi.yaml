        Finalize a company's onboarding process.

        ### Approve a company in demo

        After a company is finished onboarding, Gusto requires an additional step to review and approve that company.
        The company onboarding status is "onboarding_completed": false, until the API call is made to finish company
        onboarding. In production environments, this step is required for risk-analysis purposes.

        We provide the endpoint `PUT '/v1/companies/{company_uuid}/approve'` to facilitate company approvals in the demo environment.

        ```shell
        PUT '/v1/companies/89771af8-b964-472e-8064-554dfbcb56d9/approve'

        # Response: Company object, with company_status: 'Approved'

        Generate a link to access a pre-built workflow in Gusto white-label UI. For security, all generated flows will expire within 1 hour of inactivity or 24 hours from creation time, whichever comes first.

        You can see a list of all possible flow types in our [Flow Types](https://docs.gusto.com/embedded-payroll/docs/flow-types) guide.

        You can also mix and match flow_types in the same category to create custom flows suitable for your needs.

        For instance, to create a custom onboarding flow that only includes `add_addresses`, `add_employees`, and `sign_all_forms` steps, simply stitch those flow_types together into a comma delimited string:

        ```json
        {
          "flow_type": "add_addresses,add_employees,sign_all_forms"
        }
        ```

        Please be mindful of data dependencies in each step to achieve the best user experience.

        For more information and in-depth guides review the [Getting Started](https://docs.gusto.com/embedded-payroll/docs/flows-getting-started) guide for flows.

        Verify a company bank account by confirming the two micro-deposits sent to the bank account. Note that the order of the two deposits specified in request parameters does not matter. There's a maximum of 5 verification attempts, after which we will automatically initiate a new set of micro-deposits and require the bank account to be verified with the new micro-deposits.

        ### Bank account verification in demo

        We provide the endpoint `POST '/v1/companies/{company_id}/bank_accounts/{bank_account_uuid}/send_test_deposits'` to facilitate bank account verification in the demo environment. This endpoint simulates the micro-deposits transfer and returns them in the response. You can call this endpoint as many times as you wish to retrieve the values of the two micro deposits.

        ```
          POST '/v1/companies/89771af8-b964-472e-8064-554dfbcb56d9/bank_accounts/ade55e57-4800-4059-9ecd-fa29cfeb6dd2/send_test_deposits'

        If a company does not have any pay schedules, this endpoint will create a single pay schedule and assign it to all employees. This is a common use case during company onboarding.

        If a company has an existing active pay schedule and want to support multiple pay schedules, this endpoint will create a pay schedule that is not assigned to any employee.

        Be sure to **[check state laws](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/state/payday)** to know what schedule is right for your customers.

        Pay periods are the foundation of payroll. Compensation, time & attendance, taxes, and expense reports all rely on when they happened. To begin submitting information for a given payroll, we need to agree on the time period.

        By default, this endpoint returns pay periods starting from 6 months ago to the date today.  Use the `start_date` and `end_date` parameters to change the scope of the response.  End dates can be up to 3 months in the future and there is no limit on start dates.

        Starting in version '2023-04-01', the eligible_employees attribute was removed from the response.  The eligible employees for a payroll are determined by the employee_compensations returned from the payrolls#prepare endpoint.

        Note: Compensation data (pay rate, payment unit, and related fields) represents sensitive employee pay information. When retrieving employee job data, these fields (`rate`, `payment_unit`, `current_compensation_uuid`, `compensations`) are only returned when the `compensations:read` scope is included. This allows you to access employee and job metadata without exposing pay rates.

        Terminations are created whenever an employee is scheduled to leave the company. The only things required are an effective date (their last day of work) and whether they should receive their wages in a one-off termination payroll or with the rest of the company.

        Note that some states require employees to receive their final wages within 24 hours (unless they consent otherwise,) in which case running a one-off payroll may be the only option.

        Get attributes relevant for an employee's state taxes.

        The data required to correctly calculate an employee's state taxes varies by both home and work location. This API returns information about each question that must be answered grouped by state. Mostly commonly, an employee lives and works in the same state and will only have questions for a single state. The response contains metadata about each question, the type of answer expected, and the current answer stored in Gusto for that question.

        Answers are represented by an array. Today, this array can only be empty or contain exactly one element, but is designed to allow for forward compatibility with effective-dated fields. Until effective dated answers are supported, the `valid_from` and `valid_up_to` must always be `"2010-01-01"` and `null` respectively.

        ## About filing new hire reports
        Payroll Admins are responsible for filing a new hire report for each Employee. The `file_new_hire_report` question will only be listed if:
        - the `employee.onboarding_status` is one of the following:
          - `admin_onboarding_incomplete`
          - `self_onboarding_awaiting_admin_review`
        - that employee's work state requires filing a new hire report

        Compensations contain information on how much is paid out for a job. Jobs may have many compensations, but only one that is active. The current compensation is the one with the most recent `effective_date`. By default the API returns only the current compensation - see the `include` query parameter for retrieving all compensations.

        Note: Currently the API does not support creating multiple compensations per job - creating a compensation with the same `job_uuid` as another will fail with a relevant error.

        Use `flsa_status` to determine if an employee is eligible for overtime.

        A payroll item in Gusto is associated to an earning type to name the type of earning described by the payroll item.

        #### Default Earning Type
        Certain earning types are special because they have tax considerations. Those earning types are mostly the same for every company depending on its legal structure (LLC, Corporation, etc.)

        #### Custom Earning Type
        Custom earning types are all the other earning types added specifically for a company.

        This endpoint allows you to delete an **unprocessed** payroll.

        By default the payroll and associated data is deleted synchronously. To request an asynchronous delete, use the `async=true` query parameter. In both cases validation of ability to delete will be performed and an Unprocessable Entity error will be returned if the payroll is not able to be deleted. A successful synchronous delete will return `204/No Content`. When a payroll has been enqueued for asynchronous deletion, `202/Accepted` will be returned.

        Submits an unprocessed payroll to be calculated and run. This submission is asynchronous and a successful request responds with a 202 HTTP status. Upon success, transitions the payroll to the `processed` state.

        You should poll to ensure that payroll is processed successfully, as async errors only occur after async processing is complete.

        If the company is blocked from running payroll due to issues like incomplete setup, missing information or other compliance issues, the response will be 422 Unprocessable Entity with a categorization of the blockers as described in the error responses.

        If the version is supplied and the employee I-9 authorization exists, this endpoint acts as an update. Otherwise, it will create an employee I-9 authorization.

        Validations on this endpoint are conditional:

          * `document_type` may be required, depending on `authorization_status`.
          * Valid formats for `document_number` vary, depending on `document_type`.
          * `country` is only allowed with `document_type: 'foreign_passport'`.
          * `expiration_date` is only allowed with `authorization_status: 'alien'`.

        > ℹ️ Unneeded information is automatically removed during updates.
        >
        > If an update causes some formerly-required fields to be unneeded, the now-unneeded data will be removed automatically.
        >
        > **Example:** Updating `authorization_status` from `alien` to `citizen` will cause any data in `document_type`, `document_number`, `country`, and `expiration_date` to be removed, since these fields are unused for `authorization_status:'citizen'`.

        After resolving the underlying bank error, initiate a redebit for an open recovery case. This submission is asynchronous and a successful request responds with a 202 HTTP status.

        It may take up to four business days for the ACH debit to process; in the meantime, the status of the recovery case will be in the `initiated_redebit` state. When funds are successfully redebited, the recovery case is transitioned to the `recovered` state.

        If the company has exceeded maximum redebit attempts, or if the recovery case is not in a redebitable state, the response will be 422 Unprocessable Entity.

        Get payment details for contractors in a company. This endpoint returns a list of all contractors
        associated with the specified company, including their payment methods and bank account details
        if they are paid via direct deposit.

        For contractors paid by direct deposit, the response includes their bank account information
        with sensitive data masked for security. The payment details also include information about
        how their payments are split if they have multiple bank accounts configured.

        For contractors paid by check, only the basic payment method information is returned.

        ### Response Details
        - For direct deposit contractors:
          - Bank account details (masked)
          - Payment splits configuration
          - Routing numbers
          - Account types
        - For check payments:
          - Basic payment method designation

        ### Common Use Cases
        - Fetching contractor payment information for payroll processing
        - Verifying contractor payment methods
        - Reviewing payment split configurations

        `encrypted_account_number` is available only with the additional scope `contractor_payment_methods:read:account_numbers`.

        Create a salary estimate for an employee. This endpoint helps calculate a reasonable salary for S Corp owners based on their occupation, experience level, location, and business revenue.

        A salary estimate must include:
        - Annual net revenue of the business
        - ZIP code for location-based salary data
        - One or more occupations with experience levels and time percentages (must sum to 100%)

        Only one in-progress salary estimate can exist per employee at a time. If an in-progress estimate already exists, you must either accept it or use the update endpoint.

        Generates a report containing annual FICA (Federal Insurance Contributions Act) wage data for all employees in a company over a specified year range.

        This report provides detailed wage information subject to Social Security and Medicare taxes, useful for benefits integrations that need to verify employee earnings for compliance and benefit calculations.

        The report is generated asynchronously. After making this request, you will receive a `request_uuid` which can be used to poll the [Get a report](ref:get-v1-reports-request_uuid) endpoint to check the status and retrieve the report when complete.

                              Use threshold to define each tier's end point, with tiers applied cumulatively from 0% upwards.

                              For example:

                              If the first tier has a threshold of "3", and `rate` of "100", the company will match 100% of employee contributions from 0% up to and including 3% of payroll.

                              If the next tier has a threshold of "5" and a rate of "50", the company will match 50% of contributions from above 3% up to and including 5% of payroll.

            The mask is a sequence of characters representing the requirements of the actual account number. Each character in the mask represents a single character in the account number as follows:

            - any other character represents the literal character

            Examples:
            - mask: `WHT-######` represents `WHT-` followed by 5 digits, e.g. `WHT-33421`
            - mask: `%####-^^` supports values of `75544-AB` and `Z7654-HK`
