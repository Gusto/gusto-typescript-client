   * Verify a company bank account by confirming the two micro-deposits sent to the bank account. Note that the order of the two deposits specified in request parameters does not matter. There's a maximum of 5 verification attempts, after which we will automatically initiate a new set of micro-deposits and require the bank account to be verified with the new micro-deposits.

   * ### Bank account verification in demo
   *
   * We provide the endpoint `POST '/v1/companies/{company_id}/bank_accounts/{bank_account_uuid}/send_test_deposits'` to facilitate bank account verification in the demo environment. This endpoint simulates the micro-deposits transfer and returns them in the response. You can call this endpoint as many times as you wish to retrieve the values of the two micro deposits.
