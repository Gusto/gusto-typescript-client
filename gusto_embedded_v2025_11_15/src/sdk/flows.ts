   * Create a flow
   *
   * @remarks
   * Generate a link to access a pre-built workflow in Gusto white-label UI. For security, all generated flows will expire within 1 hour of inactivity or 24 hours from creation time, whichever comes first.
   *
   * You can see a list of all possible flow types in our [Flow Types](https://docs.gusto.com/embedded-payroll/docs/flow-types) guide.
   *
   * You can also mix and match flow_types in the same category to create custom flows suitable for your needs.
   *
   * For instance, to create a custom onboarding flow that only includes `add_addresses`, `add_employees`, and `sign_all_forms` steps, simply stitch those flow_types together into a comma delimited string:
   *
   * ```json
   * {
   *   "flow_type": "add_addresses,add_employees,sign_all_forms"
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * Please be mindful of data dependencies in each step to achieve the best user experience.
   *
   * For more information and in-depth guides review the [Getting Started](https://docs.gusto.com/embedded-payroll/docs/flows-getting-started) guide for flows.
